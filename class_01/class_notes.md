# Class 1 notes


### Python

-   We've created our first program, a simple *Hello World*, by using the following command in the terminal:

    ```
    python hello_world.py
    ```

### Linux

-   We've learned some commands to use the terminal properly, for instance:

    -   ```mkdir``` - to create a folder.
    -   ```touch``` - to create a file.
    -   ```cd``` - to change directory.
    -   ```pwd``` - to print the work directory.
    -   ```ls``` - to show the files and directories.

    And there are many more, please check [here](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners).

### Git

-   We've learned how to track a project using ```git```, and many of the commands that ```git``` has, in order to practice then, please check [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/user/MakiGAS93). You can skip the second video, since we've already installed git. Don't worry, we will cover most of the ```git``` content as the classes progress.


### Good practices

-   Always remember that we need three things in each project: a repository, a *readme.md* file and a *changelog.md* file.
