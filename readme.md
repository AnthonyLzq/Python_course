# Python course

This will be a basic/intermediate Python course. We will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). I strongly recommend you to read some documentation before the class start. Here you have the syllabus for the course:
